_Thanks for wanting to report an issue you've found in Node.js. Please delete
this text and fill in below template. If unsure about something, just do as best
as you're able._

_Note that it will be much easier for us to fix the issue if we will have a test
case that reproduces the problem. Ideally this test case should not have any
external dependencies. We understand that it is not always possible to reduce
your code to a small test case, but we will appreciate to have as much data as
possible. Thank you!_

* **Platform**: _either `uname -a` output, or if Windows version and 32-bit or
  64-bit_
