# Contributing to Node.js

Contributions to Node.js include code, documentation, answering user questions,
running the project's infrastructure, and advocating for all types of Node.js
users.

The Node.js project welcomes all contributions from anyone willing to work in
good faith with other contributors and the community. No contribution is too
small and all contributions are valued.

This guide explains the process for contributing to the Node.js project's core
`nodejs/node` GitHub Repository and describes what to expect at each step.
