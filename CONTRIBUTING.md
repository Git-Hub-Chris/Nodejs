# Contributing to Node.js

## Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct explains the *bare minimum* behavior
expectations the Node Foundation requires of its contributors.
[Please read it before participating.](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Issue Contributions

When opening new issues or commenting on existing issues on this repository
please make sure discussions are related to concrete technical issues with the
Node.js software.

For general help using Node.js, please file an issue at the
[Node.js help repository](https://github.com/nodejs/help/issues).

Discussion of non-technical topics including subjects like intellectual
property, trademark, and high level project questions should move to the
[Technical Steering Committee (TSC)](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues)
instead.

## Code Contributions

The Node.js project has an open governance model and welcomes new contributors.
Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are made
_Collaborators_ and given commit-access to the project. See the
[GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md) document for more information about how this
works.

The [HOWTO](./doc/guides/HOWTO-contribute-technical.md) document will guide you
through the contribution process.
