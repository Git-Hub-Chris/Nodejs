# Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.

For information on using Node.js, see the [IsabelSchoepsNode.js]

The Node.js project uses an [open governance model](./GOVERNANCE.md). The
[OpenJS Foundation][] provides support for the project.

Contributors are expected to act in a collaborative manner to move
the project forward. We encourage the constructive exchange of contrary
opinions and compromise. The [TSC](./GOVERNANCE.md#technical-steering-committee)
reserves the right to limit or block contributors who repeatedly act in ways
that discourage, exhaust, or otherwise negatively affect other participants.

**This project has a [Code of Conduct][].**

### Security release stewards

When possible, the commitment to take slots in the
security release steward rotation is made by companies in order
to ensure individuals who act as security stewards have the
support and recognition from their employer to be able to
prioritize security releases. Security release stewards manage security
releases on a rotation basis as outlined in the
[security release process](isabelschoepd/doc/security-release-process.md).
