## How to upgrade openssl library in Node.js

This document describes the procedure to upgrade openssl from 1.0.2e
to 1.0.2f in Node.js. This procedure might be applied to upgrading
any versions in 1.0.2.

### Build System and Upgrading Overview
The openssl build system is based on the `Configure` perl script in
`deps/openssl/openssl`. For example, running `Configure linux_x86-64`
in the openssl repository generates `Makefile` and `opensslconf.h` for
the linux_x86_64 target architecture.

The `Makefile` contains the list of asm files which are generated by
perl scripts during build so that we can get the most of use of the
hardware performance according to the type of cpus.

`Configure TABLE` shows various build parameters that depend on each
os and arch.

In Node.js, build target is defined as `--dest-os` and `--dest-cpu` in
configure options which are different from the one that is defined in
openssl and it's build system is gyp that is based on python,
therefore we cannot use the openssl build system directly.

In order to build openssl with gyp in node, files of opensslconf.h and
asm are generated in advance for several supported platforms.

Here is a map table to show conf(opensslconf.h) and asm between
the openssl target and configuration parameters of os and cpu in node.
The tested platform in CI are also listed.

- (*1) use linux-elf as a fallback configuration
- (*2) no-asm used
- (*3) currently masm (Microsoft Macro Assembler) is used but it's no
longer supported in openssl. We need to move to use nasm or yasm.

All parameters such as sources, defines, cflags and others generated
in openssl Makefile are written down into `deps/openssl/openssl.gypi`.

The `deps/openssl/openssl/crypto/opensslconf.h` header file is
generated by `Configure` and varies for each os and arch so we
created `deps/openssl/config/opensslconf.h`, which includes each
conf file from `deps/openssl/config/archs/*/opensslconf.h` by using
pre-defined compiler macros. This procedure can be processed
automatically with `deps/openssl/config/Makefile`

Assembler support is one of the key features in openssl, but asm files
are dynamically generated by the perl script 
`deps/openssl/openssl/crypto/*/asm/*.pl` during the build.
Furthermore, these perl scripts check the version of the assembler being
used and generate asm files according to the supported instructions in
each compiler.

Since perl is not a build requirement in node, they all should be
generated in advance and statically stored in the repository. We
provide two sets of asm files, one is asm_latest(avx2 and addx
supported) in `deps/openssl/asm` and the other asm_obsolete(without
avx1/2 and addx) in `deps/openssl/asm_obsolete`, which depends on
supported features in assemblers. Each directory has a `Makefile`
to generate asm files with perl scripts in openssl sources.

`configure` and gyp check the version of assemblers such as gnu
as(gas), llvm and Visual Studio. `deps/openssl/openssl.gypi`
determines what asm files should be used, in which the asm_latest
needs the version of gas >= 2.23, llvm >= 3.3 or MSVS_VERSION>='2012'
(ml64 >= 12) as defined in
https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/OpenSSL_1_0_2-stable/crypto/sha/asm/sha512-x86_64.pl#L112-L129,
otherwise asm_obsolete are used.

The following steps describe how to upgrade openssl
from version 1.0.2e to 1.0.2f in node.

*This needs to run Linux enviroment with wget and nasm installed.*

### 1. Unpack sources and fix symlinks and apply patches
```sh
$ cd deps/openssl
$ ./scripts/update.sh 1.0.2.f
```
The update script will download and unpack the OpenSSL distribution, then fix the symlinks
required for Windows, and finally apply the floating patches.

### 2. Update openssl.gyp and openssl.gypi
This process is needed when source files are removed, renamed and added.
It seldom happen in the minor bug fix release. Build errors would be
thrown if it happens. In case of build errors, we need to check source
files in Makefiles of its platform and change openssl.gyp or
openssl.gypi according to the changes of source files. Please contact
@shigeki if it is needed.

### 3. ASM files for openssl
We provide two sets of asm files. One is for the latest assembler
and the other is the older one. sections 3.1 and 3.2 describe the two
types of files. Section 3.3 explains the steps to update the files.
In the case of upgrading 1.0.2f there were no changes to the asm files.

Files changed between two tags can be manually inspected using:
```
https://github.com/openssl/openssl/compare/OpenSSL_1_0_2e...OpenSSL_1_0_2f#files_bucket
```
If any source files in `asm` directory were changed then please follow the rest of the
steps in this section otherwise these steps can be skipped.

### 3.1. asm files for the latest compiler
This was made in `deps/openssl/asm/Makefile`
- Updated asm files for each platforms which are required in
  openssl-1.0.2f.
- Some perl files need CC and ASM envs. Added a check if these envs
  exist. Followed asm files are to be generated with CC=gcc and
  ASM=nasm on Linux. See
  `deps/openssl/openssl/crypto/sha/asm/sha512-x86_64.pl`
- Added new 32bit targets/rules with a sse2 flag (OPENSSL_IA32_SSE2)
  to generate asm for use SSE2.
- Generating sha512 asm files in x86_64 need output filename which
  has 512. Added new rules so as not to use stdout for outputs.
- PERLASM_SCHEME of linux-armv4 is `void` as defined in openssl
  Configure. Changed its target/rule and all directories are moved
  from arm-elf-gas to arm-void-gas.
- add a new rule for armv8 asm generation

With export environments of CC=gcc and ASM=nasm, then type make
command and check if new asm files are generated.
If you don't have nasm please install it such as `apt-get install nasm`.

### 3.2. asm files for the older compiler
For older assembler, the version check of CC and ASM should be
skipped in generating asm file with perl scripts.
Copy files from `deps/openssl/asm` into
`deps/openssl/asm/asm_obsolete` and change rules to generate asm files
into this directories and remove the check of CC and ASM envs.

Without environments of CC and ASM, then type make command and check
if new asm files for older compilers are generated.

The following steps includes version check of gcc and nasm.

### 3.3 steps

```sh
$ cd deps/openssl
$ ./scripts/asm_update.sh
```
