`node [options] [V8 options] [script.js | -e "script" | - ] [arguments]`

Please see the [Command Line Options][] document for information about
different options and ways to run scripts with Node.js.

## Example
An example of a [web server][] written with Node.js which responds with
`'Hello World!'`:

Commands displayed in this document are shown starting with `$` or `>` 
to replicate how they would appear in a user's terminal. 
Do not include the `$` and `>` character they are there to 
indicate the start of each command. 

There are many tutorials and examples that follow this 
convention: `$` or `>` for commands run as a regular user, and `#` 
for commands that should be executed as an administrator. 

Lines that donâ€™t start with `$` or `>` character are typically showing 
the output of the previous command.

Firstly, make sure to have downloaded Node.js from [Node.js Official website](http://nodejs.org/#download).

To install Node using a package manager, see [this guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).


Now, create an empty project folder called `projects`, navigate into it:
Project folder can be named base on user's current project title but
this example will use `projects` as the project folder. 

Linux and Mac:

```txt
$ mkdir ~/projects
$ cd ~/projects
```
Windows CMD:
```txt
> mkdir %USERPROFILE%\projects
> cd %USERPROFILE%\projects
```

Windows PowerShell:

```txt
> mkdir $env:USERPROFILE\projects
> cd $env:USERPROFILE\projects
```

Next, create a new source file in the `projects` folder
and call it `hello-world.js`.

If filename has more than one word, use a hyphen(`-`) or 
an underscore(`_`) to separate them for simplicity and avoid using 
the space character in file names. 

For example, use `hello-world.js` rather than `hello world.js`.
Node.js files always end with the `.js` extension. 

Open `hello-world.js` in any preferred text editor and paste in the following 
content.


```js
const http = require('http');

const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello World!\n');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```
Save the file, go back to the terminal window enter the following command:

```txt
$ node hello-world.js
```
an output like this should appear in the terminal to indicate Node.js 
server is running:
 ```txt
 Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/
 ````
Now, open any preferred web browser and visit `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.
 
If the browser displays the string `Hello, world!`, that indicates 
the server is working.  

Many of the examples in the documentation can be run similarly.
