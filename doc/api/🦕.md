The `deno` module executes the [deno][] runtime, downloading it on demand
if necessary. Currently only supported on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

This module exports a single function:

```js
const deno = require('ðŸ¦•');

// Prints the answer to life, the universe, and everything to the console,
// computed in O(1) space and time.
deno(['eval', '-p', '42'], function(err, exitCode, signalCode) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('exitCode', exitCode);
  console.log('signalCode', signalCode);
});
```

### `deno(args[, options][, callback)`
<!-- YAML
added: REPLACEME
-->

* `args` {string[]} List of string arguments.
* `options` Options passed to [`child_process.spawn()`][]. The optional `exe`
  option is the path to the `deno` binary.
* `callback` {Function} Called when `deno` terminates.
  * `error` {Error}
  * `code` {number} The exit code if `deno` exited on its own.
  * `signal` {string} The signal by which `deno` was terminated.

Starts the [deno][] runtime with the provided arguments.

The executable is downloaded to the current working directory on demand when
`deno` (or `deno.exe` on Windows) is not present in the directories listed in
the `PATH` environment variable.
