# Technical values and priorities

These shared values are current as of this writing and are subject to evolution. They are intended to assist
newcomers in understanding which contributions align with our current direction and serve as reference points
when balancing conflicting objectives. Factors influencing each discussion or decision vary, and priority 1
doesn't always override priority 2 and so forth.
