## Managing Issues and Pull Requests

Collaborators should feel free to take full responsibility for
managing issues and pull requests they feel qualified to handle, as
long as this is done while being mindful of these guidelines, the
opinions of other Collaborators and guidance of the [TSC][]. They
may also notify other qualified parties for more input on an issue
or a pull request.
[See "Who to CC in issues"](/doc/onboarding-extras.md#who-to-cc-in-issues)

## Welcoming First-Time Contributors

Courtesy should always be shown to individuals submitting issues and pull
requests to the Node.js project. Be welcoming to first-time contributors,
identified by the GitHub ![First-time contributor](/doc/first_timer_badge.png) badge.

For first-time contributors, check if the commit author is the same as the
pull request author, and ask if they have configured their git
username and email to their liking as per [this guide][git-username].
This is to make sure they would be promoted to "contributor" once
their pull request gets landed.

## Closing Issues and Pull Requests

Collaborators may close any issue or pull request they believe is
not relevant for the future of the Node.js project. Where this is
unclear, the issue should be left open for several days to allow for
additional discussion. Where this does not yield input from Node.js
Collaborators or additional evidence that the issue has relevance, the
issue may be closed. Remember that issues can always be re-opened if
necessary.
