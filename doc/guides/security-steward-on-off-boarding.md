# Security Steward Onboarding/OffBoarding

## Onboarding

* Confirm the new steward agrees to keep all private information confidential
  to the project and not to use/disclose to their employer.
* Add them to the security-stewards team in the GitHub nodejs-private
  organization
* Add them to the standard team in H1 using this
  [page](https://hackerone.com/nodejs/team_members);
* Add them to the
  [jenkin-admins team](https://GitHub.com/orgs/nodejs/teams/jenkins-admins)
  in the GitHub nodejs org. This is needed for them to be able
  to lock/unlock the CI during a security release.
* Add them as managers of the
  [nodejs-sec](https://groups.google.com/g/nodejs-sec/members) mailing list.

## Offboarding

* Remove them from security-stewards team in the GitHub nodejs-private
  organization
* Unless they have access for another reason, remove them from the
  standard team in H1 using this
  [page](https://hackerone.com/nodejs/team_members).
* Unless they are a jenkins admin for another reason, remove them from the
  [jenkin-admins team](https://GitHub.com/orgs/nodejs/teams/jenkins-admins)
  in the GitHub nodejs org.
* Downgrade their account to regular member in the
  [nodejs-sec](https://groups.google.com/g/nodejs-sec/members) mailing list.
