# RFC: (name of feature)

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

## Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

## Guide-level explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already included in the language and you were
teaching it to another Node.js user.

* Introduce new named concepts.
* Explain the feature largely in terms of examples.
* Explain how Node.js users should think about the feature and how it might
  impact the way they use Node.js. It should explain the impact as concretely as
  possible.
* If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or
  migration guidance.

## Reference-level explanation

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in detail.

* Explain its interaction with other features.
* Explain how the would be implemented.
* Explain edge cases with examples.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and
explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

## Drawbacks

Why might we *not* do this?

## Rationale and alternatives

The goal here is *not* be to promote the proposal by presenting it as
favorably as possible. The goal is to explore options fairly and completely.

* Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
* What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not
  choosing them?
* What is the impact of not doing this?

## Prior art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.

* Does this feature exist in other programming languages? What experiences have
  their communities had and what lessons can we learn from them?
* Are there any published papers, great posts, or other references that discuss
  this?

## Unresolved questions

* Perhaps you care about a particular feature, but do not have a specific
  proposal around certain details. This is the place to list those unresolved
  questions.
* What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be
  addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this
  RFC?
