Warn when the list item marker style of unordered lists violate a given
style.

Options: `'consistent'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, or `'+'`, default: `'consistent'`.

`'consistent'` detects the first used list style and warns when subsequent
lists use different styles.

## Fix

[`remark-stringify`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/HEAD/packages/remark-stringify)
formats unordered lists using `-` (hyphen-minus) by default.
Pass
[`bullet: '*'` or `bullet: '+'`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/tree/HEAD/packages/remark-stringify#optionsbullet)
to use `*` (asterisk) or `+` (plus sign) instead.

See [Using remark to fix your Markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint#using-remark-to-fix-your-markdown)
on how to automatically fix warnings for this rule.

## Presets

This rule is included in the following presets:

| - | - |

You probably want to use it on the CLI through a config file:

 â€¦
```

Or use it on the CLI directly

```

Or use this on the API:

```diff
 import {remark} from 'remark'
 import {reporter} from 'vfile-reporter'
 import remarkLint from 'remark-lint'
 import remarkLintUnorderedListMarkerStyle from 'remark-lint-unordered-list-marker-style'

 remark()
   .use(remarkLint)
+  .use(remarkLintUnorderedListMarkerStyle)
   .process('_Emphasis_ and **importance**')
   .then((file) => {
     console.error(reporter(file))
   })
```
